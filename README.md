To use this app, you must have enabled USB Debugging in android developer settings.     
After enabling it, just go to the directory from where you want to copy from/where to copy, select the file(s) and hit the arrow to the correct copy direction       
Note: to go up a directory, double click the file header!

Note2: Its made in C# and Windows Forms. To put it on Linux/Mac I would completely have to rewrite it, so no Linux/Mac version

# If the app doesn't work install .NET 7 runtime!
